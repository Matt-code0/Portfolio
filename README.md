[🔗 Live Preview](https://mhportfolio.endora.site/)

My personal professional space showcasing my journey as a Junior Software Developer. This website acts as a hub for my projects, technical skills, and continuous learning progress after completing an intensive IT curriculum.

## 🚀 The Purpose
Instead of a static CV, I built this portfolio to demonstrate my ability to deliver functional, clean, and responsive web applications. It serves as a live proof of my technical growth and my transition from "Hello World" exercises to real-world development patterns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5** – Structured with accessibility and clean document flow in mind.
* **Bootstrap 5** – Utilizing the grid system and modern UI components.
* **SASS/SCSS** – Managing styles through variables and modular architecture.
* **JavaScript** – Enhancing user experience and interactivity.
* **FontAwesome** – Professional iconography for better visual communication.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Project Showcases:** Direct links to live demos and GitHub repositories for all my major work.
- **Tech Stack Transparency:** Clearly defined "In Progress" section showing my current learning path.
- **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for all devices, from mobile phones to ultra-wide monitors.
- **Clean Architecture:** Well-organized folder structure and semantic code for easy maintenance.
